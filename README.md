## CRUD-with-Angular-
CRUD for Angular Material Table Project showcasing my CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implementation on Angular Mat-Table. Most importantly frontend updates accordingly with operations. This is important if you're using data from backend (some DB like MySQL) but I guess It can be used for local generated data as well.

Project is updated and now runs on Angular version 16 including Angular Material 16.
